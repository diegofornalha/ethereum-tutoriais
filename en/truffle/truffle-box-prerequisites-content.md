There are a few technical requirements before we start. 
To use `Truffle boxes`, you need to have installed in your computer:

1. [Git](/en/truffle/truffle-project-prerequisites?id=git)
2. [POSIX compliant shell](/en/truffle/truffle-project-prerequisites?id=posix-compliant-shell)
3. [cURL](/en/truffle/truffle-project-prerequisites?id=curl)
4. [Node.js and NPM](/en/truffle/truffle-project-prerequisites?id=nodejs-and-npm)
5. [Code editor](/en/truffle/truffle-project-prerequisites?id=code-editor)
6. [Truffle framework](/en/truffle/truffle-project-prerequisites?id=truffle-framework)

If you don't have any of them installed, go to the tutorial
[Truffle project prerequisites](/en/truffle/truffle-project-prerequisites.md) 
which have all the instructions to setup these requirements.
