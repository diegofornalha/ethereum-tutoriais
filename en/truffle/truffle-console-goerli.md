### Gorli in Truffle config file

Take a look at the `truffle-config.js` file, 
in the `network` section, 
GÃ¶rli testnet is configured using HDWalletProvider and the mnemonic.

Perhaps your configuration is not exactly this, some updates have been made to the connection, but you will see some settings for the Goerli network.

### Connect to Gorli testnet

Run the development console for this network.

```shell
truffle console --network goerli
```
