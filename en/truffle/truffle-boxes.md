# Truffle Boxes

[Truffle Boxes](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes) are sample applications in the form of project templates. 
Every Truffle box comes with libraries and tools already preinstalled, 
code that uses those libraries and tools, external scripts (if necessary), 
as well as helpful README's and documentation. 
Also some of them have front-end views, all the way up to complete example dapps. 
The Truffle boxes are in a single and easily-downloadable package and directly integrated into the Truffle command line.
