Truffle has an interactive console that also spawns a Blockchain simulator. 
This is very useful for compiling, deploying and testing locally.

Run the development console by typing the following command below into the terminal:

```shell
truffle develop
```

This command is successful if you see a list of 10 accounts, a mnemonic and the command prompt is now `truffle(develop)>`

For example, I will open the Truffle development console in the folder `C:\ETH\my-project` 
(on Windows OS):

![Truffle development console](../../images/truffle/image-13.png)

You are now in the truffle develop console with seeded accounts and their associated private keys listed.

> [!NOTE]
> Inside the development console we don't preface commands with `truffle`.


> [!ATTENTION]
> ⚠️  Important ⚠️  : This mnemonic was created for you by Truffle. It is not secure.
>
> Ensure you do not use it on production blockchains, or else you risk losing funds.
