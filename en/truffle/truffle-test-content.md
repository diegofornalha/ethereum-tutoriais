Truffle has an automated testing framework to facilitate the testing of contracts.
All test files should be located in the `test` directory.
To learn more, go to the Truffle documentation, in the section [testing your contracts](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/testing-your-contracts).

> [!NOTE]
> The command varies slightly if you're in or outside of the development console.

**outside Truffle console**

```shell
truffle test
```

**inside Truffle console**

```shell
test
```
